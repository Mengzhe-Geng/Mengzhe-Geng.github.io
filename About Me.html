                    <p>My fascination with linguistics began during my undergraduate studies in Spanish, 
                        where I first encountered the typological differences in motion events among Mandarin Chinese, 
                        English and Spanish with regards to the well-known Talmyan typology of verb-framed and satellite-framed 
                        languages. This fascination has persisted throughout my academic career so far, and I have conducted studies on
                        motion expressions in various languages and with different methodologies. I remain interested in 
                        this topic, as I believe that a deeper crosslinguistic analysis of motion verbs, particularly through comparisons with other types of verbs, will contribute
                        to the development of theories of verbs, i.e., argument structure at the syntax-semantics interface. (2024/06/14)

                <p>My four years at Shanghai International Studies University (three as a master's student and one as a RA and TA)
                    have been a precious experience in my academic career, where I had the pleasure of meeting experts in various linguistic areas, including
                    theoretical linguistics, field linguistics and psycholinguistics. Their expertise provided me with a broad view of linguistics
                    and opened the door to this scientific discipline for me. (2024/07/08)

                    I initially rated myself an 88 (in red), but the professor later adjusted it to 95 (in blue).

                    <p>Like other natural sciences that model and predict phenomena in the natural world, 
                        (theoretical) linguistics models and predicts facts in natural languages. 
                        In my understanding, its theories should make predictions in two aspects. 
                        First, they should properly interpret data from various languages that field linguistics collects. 
                        Second, they should interpret experimental data that psycholinguistics investigates. 
                        I am now aspiring to grow up as a theoretical and experimental linguist, 
                        with a particular interest in providing a unified explanation of facts in various languages 
                        and incorporating psycholinguistic insights into theoretical studies,
                        but also remain open to conducting fieldwork that contributes to the documentation
                         of diverse linguistic phenomena. (2024/07/09)
